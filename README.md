## Key Insights
- Overall revenue shows a strong growth trend, with a sharp increase observed from 2017 onwards.
- Technology is the highest revenue-generating category, while revenue is well distributed across major categories.
- Sales are geographically concentrated in the West region, with California contributing the highest revenue.
- The Consumer segment generates the highest total revenue, while the Home Office segment has the highest average order value.
